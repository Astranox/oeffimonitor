# Ã–ffimonitor

display the Wiener Linien timetable for nearby bus/tram/subway lines on a
screen in the Metalab Hauptraum

Copy settings.template.js to settings.js and modify it for your needs (you have to add your own API key).

Written in Javascript for use on a Raspberry Pi in Midori in Kiosk mode.

You need to enable cross-site requests for this to work, since I was too lazy
to implement a JSON Proxy for the Wiener Linien API, which does not allow
cross-site requests.

In case of chrome (which I use for testing on my laptop), this can be
accomplished as follows:
```
chrome --disable-web-security
```

Note that this is neither pretty nor finished.

#### nodejs server:

Installation:
```
  git clone https://github.com/metalab/oeffimonitor
  cd oeffimonitor
  npm install
  npm run build # builds the server.js file to the root of the project.
```

Usage:
```
  npm run dev # runs site/server/index.js using babel-node on port 1337

  npm run build # builds site/server/index.js to server.js

  sudo npm start # first builds then runs server.js on port 80
```


Happy hacking!
